          <h2>Fox Facts</h2>
      <div class="cardparagraph">
        <h5>Foxes Are Like Dogs</h5>
        <p class="card_text">Foxes are members of the Canidae family, which means they're related to wolves, jackals, and dogs. They're medium-sized, weighing anywhere between 2 and 24 pounds, with pointy faces, lithe frames, and bushy tails.</div>
      <div class="cardparagraph">
        <h5>Foxes Are Solitary</h5>
        <p class="card_text">Unlike their relatives, foxes are not pack animals. When raising their young, they live in small families—called a “leash of foxes” or a “skulk of foxes” in underground burrows. Otherwise, they hunt and sleep alone.</div>
      <div class="cardparagraph">
        <h5>Foxes Are Good Parents</h5>
        <p class="card_text">Fox pups are born blind and don't open their eyes until nine days after birth. During that time, they stay with the vixen (female) in the den while the dog (male) brings them food. They live with their parents until they're 7 months old. Vixens sometimes go to great lengths to protect their pups—once, in England, a fox pup was caught in a wire trap for two weeks but survived because its mother brought it food every day.</div>
